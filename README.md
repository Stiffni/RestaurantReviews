# Restaurant Reviews App
This repo contains all the source code for a restaurant reviews app, which I'm working on in order to achieve the Udacity Web Developer Nanodegree. This projects involves responsive design, accessibility features, and caching and offline capabilities.

## Getting Started
To view this website:

1. Clone this repository to your machine
2. Start an http server - (step taken from [this repo](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1)). Open a shell prompt, then check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.)
For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.
Note - For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as python by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter python -m http.server 8000.
3. Open your favourite browser, and go to this url: `http://localhost:8000`

##Acknowledgements
This project contained starter code for a webpage, created for the Udacity Web Developer Nanodegree, which was not created by me. Some content added for this project was taken directly from the lessons in the course. Thanks Udacity team!
